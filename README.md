# Brazoswood Transonic Rocket Simulation 2023-2024
Overview
Welcome to the simulation repository for the 2023-2025 Brazoswood Transonic to Goddard Rocket, developed by Sabir Fisher. This was made to model and analyze the flight dynamics of our rocket as it approaches and exceeds the speed of sound.

Project Details

Developer: Sabir Fisher

Objective: To simulate and understand the behavior of a transonic rocket, including aspects such as drag, thrust, and aerodynamic changes.

Target: Brazoswood High School Rocketry Program

Features
Air Density Calculation: Estimates the density of air at different altitudes using temperature and pressure adjustments.
Drag Coefficient Modeling: Provides a dynamic calculation of the drag coefficient based on the Mach number, covering subsonic to hypersonic speeds.
Thrust Prediction: Integrates a machine learning model for predicting thrust based on current altitude and other parameters.

How to Use
Setup: Ensure Python 3.x and necessary libraries (numpy, sklearn) are installed.
Running Simulations: Execute the main simulation script to start the simulation. Parameters can be adjusted in the script for different scenarios.
Data Analysis: After running simulations, analyze the output data for insights into rocket performance and aerodynamics.
